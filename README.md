**Password Generator**

**Overview**:

This project is a simple yet robust password generator developed during my introductory Python programming course at Georgia State University. As the team leader in a group of three, I took on the majority of the work due to unresponsive teammates, which required me to drastically adjust the project scope to meet deadlines. This project not only showcases my fundamental Python skills but also my ability to adapt and persevere in the face of challenges.

The password generator allows users to create strong, customizable passwords based on their preferences, including the option to include letters, numbers, and symbols. Users can generate a single password or multiple at once, analyze their strength, and assign expiration dates. Additionally, the program maintains a password history to prevent reuse and provides an option to save generated passwords to a file for later reference.

The project consists of three main files. main.py serves as the entry point, handling user interaction, gathering password preferences, and managing workflow. passwordgenerator.py contains core functions responsible for password generation, strength analysis, and expiration date assignment. filemanager.py manages password storage, including saving passwords to a file and tracking password history.

To use the program, run main.py in a Python environment and follow the prompts to specify password preferences. The program will generate a password (or multiple passwords), assess their strength, and provide an expiration date. Users also have the option to save their generated passwords to a file. The project requires Python 3.x and utilizes built-in Python libraries without any external dependencies. Running the program is as simple as executing python main.py in the terminal or command prompt.

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of Python fundamentals, including user input handling, string manipulation, file operations, and object-oriented programming. I also gained valuable experience in leadership and problem-solving, adapting to unexpected challenges while ensuring project completion. Looking forward, I aim to enhance this project by adding a graphical user interface (GUI), encrypting saved passwords for better security, and integrating industry-standard password strength recommendations.

This password generator is a testament to my growth as a developer and my ability to navigate challenges effectively. Developed as part of my coursework at Georgia State University, this project demonstrates both my technical abilities and my resilience in overcoming obstacles.
